# Multiclass-Fish-Image-Classification

**Problem Statement:**

This project focuses on classifying fish images into multiple categories using deep learning models.

The task involves training a CNN from scratch and leveraging transfer learning with pre-trained models(VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNet, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB0) to enhance performance.

The project also includes saving models for later use and deploying a Streamlit application to predict fish categories from user-uploaded images.
